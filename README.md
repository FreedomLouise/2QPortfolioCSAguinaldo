### Website title: Paper Hearts
### Logo: ![Logo](/assets/logo.png)
### Description: 
The visual novel, (website game), was created by Avery Ababon and Freedom Louise Aguinaldo, fans of Death Note and Bleach. This game is a crossover of the two fandoms and there would be no superpowers here. It would be a typical school AU with romance. (Both anime belong to their respective authors. We‚Äôre just fans).

The games begin when Light, Misa, and the player ‚Äî three exchange students from Daikoku Private Academy ‚Äî arrive at Karakura High School. The choice of which student to end up with depends on the player. Ichigo and Light, the main leads or other students that might be involved.

Tell about yourself
Uhh hey guys! Happy Halloween! We are bleach/death note fans and our anime is so good, so go watch it!!! <br><br>
Hi, it‚Äôs Avery ! Do you know about the anime Death Note? The story is really intense, even if it doesn‚Äôt have the typical fight scenes or romance in common anime. It has a cool and intense plot that really makes you think. Not only that, the character designs are also top-tier, making them look eye-catching, and their personalities are just as good as their looks because they‚Äôre smart both in EQ and IQ! The plot also makes you root for the bad guy, which is different from what you see in a majority of animes. <br><br>
Hey guys! It's me, Freedom! Do you love the anime, Bleach? Me too! Its fight scenes will keep you entertained and keep you on your toes (no seriously it has many cliffhangers and put a filler in between). The characters look so pretty and hot and sometimes the anime will make you question yourself when this character dies or how their plot armor saves them after getting beaten up really badly. <br><br>
#### Why you made this:
We made this game to express our love for anime, specifically Bleach and Deathnote, and to also show our interest in games.

### Page 4: Character Page
#### Bleach:
1. Main:
* Ichigo Kurosaki: Main lead<br>
Ichigo Kurosaki is one of the main love interests of the player. He is a delinquent with a surprising high standing of grade. He‚Äôs chill with everyone unless they hurt him, his friends, or his family.<br><br>
* Orihime Inoue: rival/friend <br>
Orihime Inoue is one of the friends and rivals the player will encounter. She has a crush on Ichigo and inhales food. Even if she‚Äôs a bit (no she is) airheaded, she has good grades. <br><br>
2. Side: 
* Uryu Ishida: friend/possible lover<br>
Uryu Ishida is one of the friends the player will encounter. He is smart and looks unapproachable due to his stern attitude. <br><br>
* Sado ‚ÄúChad‚Äù Yasutora: friend/possible lover<br>
Sado Yasutora is one of the friends the player will encounter. He somehow always gets his pet bird to come with him and he is a gentle giant.<br><br>
### Death Note:
1. Main:
* Light Yagami: Main lead <br>
Light Yagami is the second main love interest who‚Äôs really smart and also manipulative. Everyone loves him because he looks attractive and has really good grades.<br><br>
* Misa Amane: friend/rival<br>
Misa Amane is a popular girl who is famous for her looks. She gets angry easily and gets protective over Light. She basically automatically hates whoever likes Light. Despite being a trouble maker, her grades are still somehow high.<br><br>

### Page 5: Visual novel / mechanics 
Like a typical visual novel game, the player can choose dialogue options to move further into the story. Each choice can either move you closer to a love interest. There will be 4 main endings, but it will also have 2 secret endings.

JS description: JS will be used in the visual novel‚Äôs transitions and code. It will also be used for some transitions in the website.
