  <h3>
    What is Bleach Brave Souls?
  </h3>

  <p>
    Bleach Brave Souls is a mobile, PC, and PlayStation game based on the Bleach anime. Developed and published by KLab Global Pte. Ltd. in 2015, it recently celebrated its 10th anniversary in September. The game features the complete Bleach storyline, including the latest anime adaptation (with updates to come as Cour 4 is released), with the main story covering the main arcs and the filler episodes available in a separate side story section. Players can access all characters from Bleach, both canonical and filler. Additionally, the game includes characters from Burn the Witch, another story by Bleach creator Tite Kubo, which explores the United Kingdom side of Soul Society 10 years after the final arc of Bleach (Soul Society is the name of the place in the afterlife).  
  </p>

  <h3>
    Why I love the game:
  </h3>

  <p>
    Bleach Brave Souls is my favorite game since it came from my favorite anime, Bleach. It lures me in further when I see the beautiful cards that contain my favorite characters or characters I find pretty or useful to help me in my gameplay.
  </p>

  <p>
    Other than that, I also play it since it contains novels that the author made. Like Can’t Fear Your Own World (CFYOW), it was included there even if it wasn’t even animated yet. It’s generous in giving more information after the events of the end of Bleach for the fans that don't have the novels.
